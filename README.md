# SimpleSFSample

 A sample system for ScenarioFlow with practical functions. It contains functions like displaying dialogue lines, replacing character images, moving characters, and so on, but dosn't contain functions for save.

To run example:

+ Open `SimpleSFSample/SampleScene`
+ Set a scenario script in the `SimpleSFSample/Stories` folder to the `ScenarioScript` property on the `ObjectBuilder` object
    + There are the three available scripts, `Quiz(SFText)`, `Quiz(Composite)`, `Quiz_Alt(SFText)` by default
+ Enter the play mode


### CAUTION

All the scripts in `SimpleSFSample` are published under the MIT license, so you can use them freely as long as you follow the license. However, the use of the images used in the sample, for example, images of Sheena, Rio, and other UIs, is permitted only for private use intended for learning purposes or citation.
